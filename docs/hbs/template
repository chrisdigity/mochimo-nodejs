## Before you begin...
You might want to familiarise yourself with some Mochimo codebase *lingo*...

**Transaction Buffer**<br>
The entire TX object used for communication between nodes

**Transaction Data**<br>
The data contained within the Transaction Buffer (usually a Network Transaction)

**Capability Bits**<br>
The bits of a byte after the version byte of a transaction buffer, indicating a
Node's capabilities on the network

**Operation Codes**<br>
Number codes used during socket connection to request certain operations with
the Mochimo Network

**Transaction Address**<br>
The full quantum resistant address used by the Mochimo Cryptocurrency Network

**Source/Destination/Change Addresses**<br>
Due to the security concern of using "One Time Signatures" (see WOTS+), a
standard transaction consists of 3 addressable parts:
 - The source address; the address where funds are transferred from,
 - The destination address; the address where funds are transferred to (the
amount of funds that are transferred to this address is determined by the value
of an associated "sendtotal" property), and
 - The change address; the address where the remaining funds that weren't sent
to the destination address are received (the amount of funds that are
transferred to this address is determined by the value of an associated
"changetotal" property)

With that out of the way, let's begin...
